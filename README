Collection of scripts for converting graal ".nw" level files and
corresponding game data into png image files.

This might later also later include a tool for converting ".nw" files
to a format supported by the tiled map editor, but that functionality
is not present at the time of writing.

My interest in converting level files to images is for archival
purposes and nostalgia.

To use this script, create a directory within this project called
sprites and copy your pics1.png file into that directory, as well as
any folders of images to be used by NPCs.

You can then run the following commands:

 > python nw2png.py path_to_level.nw [alternate_pics1.png] [alternate output file]
 > python batch.py folder_of_levels [alternate_pics1.png]
 > python nw_parser.py path_to_level.nw

nw2png.py converts a level and its npcs to a png file.  It is able to do
light effects, zoom, and reposition npcs based on their scripts.

batch.py calls nw2png on the level files in a provided folder

nw_parser.py is a .nw parser, and when called directly, it outputs
debug info.  nw_parser.py is imported by nw2png.py
