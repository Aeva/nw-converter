Collection of scripts for converting graal ".nw", ".graal", and
".zelda" level files and corresponding game data into png image files
or tiled tmx files.

Users interested in converting their levels into something more
archivally friendly for the purpose of viewing will want to use the
nw2png.py utility.

Users interested in converting their data into an open format, so that
it can be adapted for use with game engines that support the Tiled map
editor tmx format will want to use the nw2tiled.py utility instead.


Please note the following limitations:

 - Support for files with the headers "Z3-V1.01" or "Z3-V1.02" is
   speculative, as I don't have any examples to test with.

 - For .graal and .zelda files, this project currently can only parse
   tile data.

 - For .nw files, there is very limited support for NPCs: the
   appearance of NPCs is approximated by pattern matching the NPC's
   gscript.

 - There is currently no support for generating collision data in
   tmx exports.

 - There is no intention to support converting gscript to other
   languages, nor is there any intention to provide a means of
   executing gscript.


To use this script, create a directory within this project called
sprites and copy your pics1.png file into that directory, as well as
any folders of images to be used by NPCs.


To convert levels to png images, use the nw2png.py script:

 > python nw2png.py path_to_level.nw [path_to_pics1.png] [output_file.png]


To convert levels to Tiled tmx maps, use the nw2tiled.py script:

 > python nw2tiled.py path_to_level.nw [path_to_pics1.png] [output_file.tmx]


An experimental GTK3 frontend is also available, which supports
conversion to either png or tmx.

 > python converter_gui.py
